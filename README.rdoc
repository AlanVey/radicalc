Workflow

check out the dev branch

create a new branch with `git checkout -b my_feature_name`

create tests

make changes and commits. It is ok to push with `git push origin my_feature_name` even if tests fail

once feature is complete and tests pass, submit a pull request back into dev

another team member must review the code and provide feedback

if the code is ready to ship, the reviewer marks a :ship: and merges the pull request
