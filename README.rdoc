RadiCalc is a web based social networking E-Learning platform designed to improve communication be- tween students and lecturers about their university courses. Users are able to create topics which they can invite other users to subscribe to. Each topic has space for open discussions about general issues and technical course material. Course administrators can create assessments for students to complete so they are better prepared for exams. The site also provides users with proficiency graphs for each of their subscribed topics. Our application provides a clearer picture to lecturers of how well their students are understanding the course, and also help students to improve their proficiency through discussion.
